Introduction:
	I am Jason, I am the head administrator at Balham College.
	I am here to present our web application, and show some of its features.
	I will talk about the projects background, give some demonstrations,
	show what I learnt in its creation, and then we can take questions.

Project Background:
	Balham College needed an information system to manage its courses, programmes and results
	The College's web interface functions in the browser through a website
	We opted for a website as it is cross platform and not dependant on the user installing it

Demonstration:

	"Lets start by logging in"
	Log in (p_admin Password1)
	Describe main menu, nav bar etc
	"Lets say we need to add a course to the college"
	Add a Course:
		Show off features such as number ticker, describe interface
		Add a course with following data
		Name: "Hardwae Fundamentals" - Hardware is mispelt intentionally
		Credits: "15"
		Fee: "400.00"
		Status: "Current"
	"Lets take a look at the course we added, along with all of the others"
	Produce Report:
		Describe layout, it looks similar to the last one
		Generate report
		Describe the information we are shown
	"Looks like we made a mistake, lets fix that"
	Update Course:
		Select "Hardwae Fundamentals"
		Fix name to "Hardware Fundamentals"
		Close
	"Lets say that the college is no longer giving a certificate in game design"
	Delete Programme:
		"We can select our game design course"
		Delete programme "Certificate in Game Design"


	"With that, you can see the functionality of this website, and how easy it is to quickly manipulate
	courses and programmes"
What Have I Learnt:
	Go Off Slide
